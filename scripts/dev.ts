/**
 * Development supervisor.
 *
 * Two processes have to run together — Vite building the client, and the server
 * that owns the socket and forwards everything else to it — and they have to
 * stop together too.
 *
 * The obvious shell version, `vite & server`, does not. The backgrounded half
 * ends up in a different process group from the one the terminal signals on
 * Ctrl-C, so stopping the visible process leaves Vite and its esbuild child
 * running, holding a port and several hundred megabytes. The next start then
 * silently talks to whichever of them the OS resolves first.
 *
 * Two things make this reliable. Each child is given its own process group and
 * killed as a group, so nothing beneath it is left behind. And each is spawned
 * directly rather than through `bun run`, because that wrapper does not exit
 * when the thing it started dies — it sits there with no child, and a
 * supervisor watching it would never learn that Vite had gone.
